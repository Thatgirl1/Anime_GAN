Thanks to a big guy who provided an anime avatar from a web crawler.
Since the image downloaded from the Internet may have noise,
the details may deviate from the feature extraction.
Therefore, in order to improve the realism of the image data generated by DCGAN,
I deliberately cleaned the original image to reduce the effects of noise and uneven light intensity.

感谢某位大佬的提供的网上爬虫下来的动漫头像。
由于网上下载下来的图像部分可能存在着噪声，细节上会偏离特征的提取，
因此为了能够提高DCGAN生成的图片数据更加真实感，
我特意对原始图像进行清理噪声和光线强度不均匀带来的影响
